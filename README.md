# Movie-Genre-Classification
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify movies into genres based on their plot summaries or other textual data. The goal is to create a robust classifier that accurately predicts movie genres using textual features extracted from the dataset.

Objectives
Preprocess textual data to generate numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Train and evaluate multiple classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Optimize model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Dataset
The dataset contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres. This data is preprocessed and cleaned to enhance feature extraction and improve model performance.

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.).
Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Training:

Training multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Evaluation:

Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
